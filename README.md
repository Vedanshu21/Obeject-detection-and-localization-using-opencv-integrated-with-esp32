# Obeject-detection-and-localization-using-opencv-integrated-with-esp32
This project explores the potential of
ESP32-CAM's hardware capabilities combined with OpenCV and YOLO for seamless integration of advanced computer vision
techniques on a compact board for real-time, efficient, and accurate object detection directly at the edge.

## Dataset
This project uses COCO dataset. (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale image recognition dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks. It contains over 330,000 images, each annotated with 80 object categories
